# Hydro Mesh Data Requirements for CaMa-Flood and CoLM2024

EarthMesh v3 hydro-mesh support starts with a conservative hybrid representation:
small channels are aggregated or represented as 1D river edges, medium channels are
1D edges plus refinement buffers, and major rivers/estuaries/coastal wetlands become
2D river-corridor candidates.

## Data needed now

To move from the current tested CSV classifier to real CaMa-Flood ingestion, provide
one small representative CaMa-Flood map directory or NetCDF subset for the target
resolution and domain.

Required river fields:

- Reach or grid-cell center longitude.
- Reach or grid-cell center latitude.
- Downstream topology, such as a downstream cell index or `nextxy`-style pair.
- Upstream drainage area, preferably in square kilometers or with clear units.
- River channel width, preferably in meters or with clear units.
- River segment length, preferably in meters or kilometers with clear units.

Useful optional river/floodplain fields:

- Floodplain width or floodplain area.
- Floodplain elevation or bankfull elevation.
- Mean or bankfull discharge.
- Inundation fraction or floodplain storage diagnostics.
- Basin identifier or river order.
- River mouth, estuary, or ocean outlet flags if available.

CoLM2024 and EarthMesh fields:

- Target EarthMesh domain: global, China, a named basin, or a coastal bounding box.
- Target minimum EarthMesh cell size for the first case.
- CoLM2024 landtype/surface dataset path used by the intended case.
- Whether the first 2D river corridors should include only estuaries and mainstems,
  or also floodplains and coastal wetlands.

## Current implemented file formats

The first implementation accepts a CSV reach inventory with these columns:

```csv
reach_id,upstream_area_km2,width_m,floodplain_width_m,target_dx_km,is_estuary,is_delta,is_coastal_wetland,is_major_confluence,user_force_2d
```

Boolean columns accept `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `yes`, `no`, and empty values.
Missing optional boolean columns default to false.

## Current output classes

- `R0`: ignored or aggregated subgrid channel.
- `R1`: explicit 1D river edge only.
- `R2`: 1D river edge plus EarthMesh refinement buffer.
- `R3`: explicit 2D river corridor candidate plus 1D topology.

## Validation expectations

Before using the products in an EarthMesh/CoLM2024 workflow, validate that:

1. Required CaMa-Flood fields are detected by `util.hydro_mesh.cama_contract`.
2. Classified reaches include continuous R3 mainstem/estuary segments rather than isolated fragments.
3. R2/R3 classes do not create a mesh-size explosion for the target domain.
4. Generated masks remain inside the EarthMesh domain.
5. CoLM2024 receives both land mesh metadata and river-to-land mapping metadata.
